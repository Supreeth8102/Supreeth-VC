# AI-Generated Prompts Log
# This file records the prompts used to generate parts of the Wrangler extension project using AI tooling.

## Grammar
Prompt: "Generate ANTLR grammar lexer rules for byte size units like KB, MB and time duration like ms, s, m, h"

## Parser Classes
Prompt: "Create a Java class that parses strings like '1.5MB' into bytes"
Prompt: "Create a Java class that parses time strings like '2h', '30m', '45s' into milliseconds"

## Directive
Prompt: "Write a Wrangler directive that aggregates total byte size and time duration from two columns"

## Persistence
Prompt: "How to store and retrieve state across rows in a Wrangler directive"

## Unit Testing
Prompt: "Write JUnit tests for parsing byte size strings like '1GB', '512KB', etc."
Prompt: "Write JUnit tests for parsing time durations like '1h', '30s'"

## Integration Testing
Prompt: "Example usage of TestingRig in Wrangler for recipe execution"
Prompt: "Write a test to verify the aggregate-stats directive outputs correct totals from rows"

## Documentation
Prompt: "Write README usage instructions for a Wrangler directive that parses byte and time units"
